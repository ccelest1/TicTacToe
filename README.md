# WELCOME TO MY TIC TAC TOE GAME

- Written in python with two files `helpers.py` and `main.py`

- Game is played via the CLI
    * Players can put down their individual pieces by indicating chosen spots on the board
    * Typical wins involve three in a row: horizontally, vertically, diagonally
    * Ties can occur if no individual player ends up with a winning scenario
    * If an invalid spot or a spot already claimed is chosen, game will communicate that to player and ask for another spot to be chosen

- To run game:
    * (1) git clone `https://github.com/ccelest1/TicTacToe.git`
    * (2) cd `~/TicTacToe`
    * (3) run `python main.py`
